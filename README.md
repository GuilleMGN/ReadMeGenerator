# Professional README Generator

## Description
This project is designed to allow a user to answer a series of prompts from node that will help them generate a professional looking README file. The README grabs the users input and outputs them into sections of the file, which include: Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, License, and Questions. This can benefit the user by saving them time in designing a README, so all they would have to do is just input their project's information, and it would all be generated for them. 

## Usage
This project uses technologies that would require prior installation including node.js. Once node is installed, you would have to install node modules by running the code 'npm init' in your terminal or GitBash. After this you would have to install the dependencies and the inquirer module by running 'npm i inquirer'. These are not in this repository due to security reasons, and thats why I have excluded it in my .gitignore file to avoid tracking or uploading these files to GitHub. Once these are installed, you are ready to run the code by typing in 'node index.js' which will output the series of prompts to generate the README. By the end of the questions, a feedback message will appear to let the user know if it succeeded in generating the readme, or display the error. The questionnaire will also display a message to the user if they input a blank title or an invalid email. 

## Examples
There is a walkthrough video and an example of a generated README file created by the questionnaire in the /ReadMeGeneratorExample folder in the repository. Also, heres the [Link to the video](https://youtu.be/5RZFUM4IbcY)
